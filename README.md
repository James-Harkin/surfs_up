# surfs_up

# Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to provide our client with weather information that may effect their decision on opening an ice cream surf shop.
# Results: 
* The average weather is above 71 degrees in December! So staying open year round is viable
* The weather changes only about 3 to 4 degrees from June to December.
* On the hottest days, the temperature can get over 80, even in December.

In summary, the results show that the temperature in Oahu does not fluctuate very much. For a deeper analysis I would want to compare the weather data we have with sales data for other ice cream shops on the island. The weather effects sales, but I want to know how. If its cold AND rainy, do sales completely plumit? Is it more likely to rain if its cold? How often is it cold AND rainy?
